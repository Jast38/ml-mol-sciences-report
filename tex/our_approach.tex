\section{Our approach}

In order to further strengthen our understanding, we decided to implement some graph machine learning methods ourselves.
We had two ideas in mind: try something really simple and see if it works, and try something more complex and see if it works.
For the really simple method, we used random walk based methods.

\subsection{Random walks based graph machine learning}

A walk on graph is a unambiguously sequence of vertices and edges, where each vertex is connected to the next vertex by an edge.
A random walk is a walk where the next vertex is chosen randomly from the set of vertices that are connected to the current vertex.
