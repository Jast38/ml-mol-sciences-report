\begin{abstract}
  We present our research on graph machine learning that we have made as part of the bachelor research project.
  We started our project examining DeepChem and MoleculeNet but later decided to focus on graph machine learning in general.
  During our project we had two main goals: to learn about graph machine learning in general and implement some graph machine learning algorithms ourselves.
  Therefore our report is structured as followed: first we give an overview of graph machine learning and then we present our own implementations of some graph machine learning algorithms.
